# Project Outline


### Overview
Brewd is the coffee web application every caffeine lover has been waiting for. Coffee is a beloved resource globally and has surpassed consumption of a combined 500 billion cups annually. Brewd is the place for the users who take pride in their habit and want to organize, celebrate, and watch their collection grow over time with like minded users from their community and beyond. Users will be able to create a profile that will allow them to catalog the details a coffee nerd wants to see: location, beverage name, bean type, source, roast, general taste, and presentation. The idea came around because I always love and appreciate latte art from my baristas, and enjoy snapping pictures of my steamy froth but nothing ever comes of them and wanted a space to expand the hobby. 


### Features
user create profile, user validation, delete profile
create new posts, fill out graphic surveys to rate their experience, post pictures of cafe and coffee, any final comments.
